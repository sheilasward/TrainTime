# TrainTime

To view this project, go to:  https://sheilasward.github.io/TrainTime/

This program generates a train schedule which updates each train time automatically.  There are originally 3 trains - if these need to be added to the database, there is a line (commented out) in the HTML where you can first run TrainSeed, which will put these 3 original trains in the database.  Otherwise, you just want to run the TrainTime.js.  You can add new trains, and the program will add them also to the database.  The database is Firebase, and is for permanent storage.
